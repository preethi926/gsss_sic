    Farmer Problem Statement
Mahesh is a farmer and owns 80 acres of land. His land is equally divided into 5 segments. He grows
tomatoes in the 1st segment, potatoes in the 2nd segment, cabbage in the 3rd segment, sunflower in
the 4th segment and sugarcane in the 5th segment.
He is converting his land from chemical-driven farming to chemical-free farming. Mahesh starts with
the conversion of vegetables into chemical-free produce. He spends the first 6 months doing the same.
He then converts the sunflower land bank into chemical-free farming. This takes him another 4
months. Finally, he converts sugarcane into chemical-free farming over the next 4 months.

b. Sales realisation from chemical-free farming at the end of 11 months?



Day 3:

-->Learn output formatting in string =%s and %data
-->why in python we do not have increment and decrement operator
-->learn about __main__
-->what is pp3 and pythonic
to learn all this use web=dox.python.org

-->how to pass command line argument into my_range function
-->why in python there is no implicit type casting
    ex='abc'+12   is type error, it do not add string and number
--> In and out of how functions work on its operations
