this is my first repo in git


MY_NOTES

-->to run code which is saved in VS opem CMD and take the path of code and type=python filename.py and enter it will show output
-->clone to git=refer SS
-->ARGV=command line argument 
-->ARGV[0] stores file name in python
-->functions which are called independently are called functions
-->map is used access all element one by one
-->putc=standard output charcater(space)
-->pymysql is act as bridge like transaltor
-->class is solution for entity(object)
-->all types of errors are children and Except is parent class



-->keywords in Exception handling
   1.try
   2.Except
   3.throw
   4.catch
   5.raise

-->print=it is the function of core python which takes input from the user
-->DR Subramanyaswami talk in YOU TUBE and sadguru in law collage
-->for EOF in cmd use cntrl+c to stop the code runner
-->tabs and spaces are different in VS code because in indentation spaces are different in different OS , they both are not termination character as well
    ex= in node it use 2 space for indentation
        in python it uses 4 spaces 
-->whenevr u want to send many values u have to use tuples for binding
-->Lists in python
   list as DS
   what is DS
   Birth of DS like list
   users
   pros and cons
   alternatives=for array it is linked list(elements in linked list are not stored in continueous....TC=O(n),,,,SC=n)
   beyond list
-->list is the collection of items/data
   all the elements are stored in contagious memory location that is if any 2 consecutive elements then there is no gap in between them
-->DATA STRUCTURE=  arrenge tha data in specific way where there is no ambiguity ,,,, with time efficiancy,space efficiency and similpicity
-->dma
   allocation and deallocation is u neither create nor delete in python
-->users= 
-->abstraction and encapsulation are 2 phases of same coin, if abstraction is there then encapsulation is also there
   ABSTRACTION=bstraction is the concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object
   ENCAPSULATION=Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (variables) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit
-->Class is complete solution for an entity, what we have defined in class are entity, what we create is object
-->in one class we have multiple choice of object
-->POLYMORPHISM= 
-->reference value is nothing but address
-->list method= list() #creating+initializing
                append() #adding element at rear(last) it returns none
                pop() #delete last element and returns
                insert() #inseting element eith specific index
                remove() #do not return the element
                sort()
                reverse()
                extend() #it iterable string
-->sort is mutator(we can modify)
